# Overview
This project demonstrate threat detection and automated response utilizing **Active Directory** for user authentication, **Splunk(SIEM/IDS)** for event detection and logging, and **Shuffle with Slack(SOAR)** for automated alert and respone.

The logical diagram illustrates how communication and data flow are standardized across systems. The scenario simulates an adversary gaining unauthorized access to a domain-joined test machine. This triggers telemetry from the test machine to Splunk, which detects the unauthorized sucessful login and initiates two actions:

1. Sends an alert notification to Slack, a multi-purpose platform used for communication, threat detection, and incident response as part of this projectâ€™s workflow.

2. Sends a webhook to Shuffle, which triggers an automated SOAR playbook in response to the unauthorized login attempt. The playbook notifies a Security Personnel, who decides to either disable the compromised account or take no action. If the account is disabled, Shuffle & the Domain Controller executes the action, and a confirmation message is sent to Slack.

# Machine Configuration

The project consist of 4 virtual machines, 3 being on the cloud (Oracle Cloud Provider) and 1 being on-prem. The 3 virtual machine on the cloud consist of the Splunk Server, Domain Controller, Domain User/Test Machine. The last virtual machine is on-prem acting as an adversary machine attacking the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Lastly, there's an personal computer that is able to interact with all 4 virtual machine and the entire environment.

*Three virtual machines including Splunk, a test machine, and a domain controller are connected to the same subnet in the same virtual private cloud (VPC).*

![Ingress Rules](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TravisMa07/active-directory-siem-soar-detection-response/refs/heads/main/ADSSDR_INGRESS_RULES.png)
*Ingress firewall rules allowing all source IP to send data to 22(SSH), 3389(RDP), and ICMP.*
<br/>
*For an real enterprise network, **DO NOT ALLOW ALL SOURCE IP**. For this lab in particular, instead of using my public IP as the source IP, I allow all source IP as it's not a production environment and is not of importance to the scope of this lab.*

*Egress firewall rules allowing outbound ICMP packets to other nodes to test connectvity.*

# Active Directory Configuration

In the logical diagram, two VMs are being used, one for the Domain Controller and one as an User of the Domain. 

1. travis-ADDC01 Machine will be the Domain Controller
2. Test Machine will be a new user created under the Domain.
